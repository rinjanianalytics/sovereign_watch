## 2024-05-24 - Do not leak exception details in HTTP 500 responses
**Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure
**Learning:** `backend/api/routers/tracks.py` was returning internal database exception details to users by passing `str(e)` to `HTTPException(detail=...)`. Exposing exception information and stack traces enables attackers to profile the internal structure of the database or infrastructure.
**Prevention:** Catch generic exceptions, log them securely internally, and return a sanitized, non-specific error message (e.g., "Internal server error") to the client.
## 2026-03-02 - Avoid Overly Permissive CORS and Missing Security Headers
**Vulnerability:** Overly Permissive CORS
**Learning:** js8call/server.py had an overly permissive CORS configuration (allow_origins=["*"]) combined with a missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP) and HSTS. This misconfiguration posed a high risk since the server bridges WebSockets to local hardware (KiwiSDR / JS8Call radio service), meaning malicious third-party websites could initiate connections to this local server, exposing or manipulating local infrastructure.
**Prevention:** Never use wildcard CORS in applications that interface with local hardware or user credentials. Bind allow_origins to an explicit whitelist via environment variable (e.g., ALLOWED_ORIGINS). Apply standard security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options) symmetrically across all services and components, not just the primary backend API.
