=======

## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-23

### Refactored

- **Backend Architecture:**
  - **Modular API Structure:** Decomposed the monolithic `backend/api/main.py` into a scalable package structure with `routers`, `services`, `core`, and `models`.
  - **Core Logic Migration:** Centralized configuration (`config.py`) and database management (`database.py`) in the `core` module.
  - **Service Extraction:** Moved background tasks (`historian`) and protocol helpers (`tak`) to dedicated `services` modules.
  - **Route Separation:** Split API endpoints into `system`, `tracks`, and `analysis` routers for better organization.
- **Aviation Poller:**
  - **Renaming:** Renamed `backend/ingestion/poller` to `backend/ingestion/aviation_poller` to clearly distinguish it from other ingestion sources.
  - **Code Modularization:** Refactored the aviation poller into `service.py`, `classification.py`, `arbitration.py`, and `utils.py`, with a clean `main.py` entry point.
  - **Docker Configuration:** Updated `docker-compose.yml` to reflect the new build context for the `adsb-poller` service.
- **Maritime Poller:**
  - **Code Modularization:** Refactored `backend/ingestion/maritime_poller` into `service.py`, `classification.py`, and `utils.py` for consistency and maintainability.
- **Orbital Pulse:**
  - **Code Modularization:** Refactored `backend/ingestion/orbital_pulse` into `service.py` and `utils.py` to decouple SGP4 propagation and TLE fetching logic from the main entry point.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Globe Rendering Architecture:**
  - **Interleaved Binding Reversion:** Explicitly disabled interleaved mode in `TacticalMap` (`interleaved: false`) and restored the pure `useControl` prop passthrough in `MapboxAdapter.tsx` to ensure absolute stability and prevent "double-wrapping" projection crashes in Deck.GL v9.
  - **Explicit Projection Mapping:** Manually pass `projection: { name: 'globe' }` to the `MapboxOverlay` init when in globe mode to correctly warp the 2D WebGL canvas over Mapbox's 3D sphere without requiring interleave integration.
  - **Camera Synchronization:** Removed the hardcoded `viewState` lock in `deckProps` for globe mode, allowing the 2D Deck.GL overlay to natively query Mapbox for real-time pitch and bearing during rotation and panning.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Tactical Compass Restoration:**
  - **HUD HUD Restoration:** Restored internal tactical crosshairs and degree ticks to the `Compass.tsx` component.
  - **Dynamic Scaling:** Implemented full dynamic scaling for all compass elements (needle, tail, glow) to support any `size` prop.
  - **Structural Alignment:** Refactored the internal rendering structure to ensure background glow effects remain perfectly centered during layout shifts.
- **Enhanced Entity Tracking:**
  - **Sidebar Size Increase:** Upscaled the tracking compass to 180px in the right sidebar for maximum legibility.

### Changed

- **UI Streamlining:**
  - **Sidebar Cleanup:** Removed the redundant "Classification" row from the Metadata Source section to reduce visual clutter.
  - **Intel Feed Refinement:** Stripped redundant category info from orbital event messages, relying on dedicated tactical badges instead.

### Fixed

- **Compass Aesthetics:** Fixed a bug where cardinal labels (N, E, S, W) were hardcoded to green; they now correctly inherit the target's theme-matched accent color.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Satellite-First Intelligence Integration:**
  - **Orbital Object Counter:** Integrated satellites into the `SystemStatus` widget. The "Total Objects" calculation now includes Aviation, Maritime, and Orbital assets with a dedicated purple visual metric.
  - **Selected Satellite Events:** Selecting a satellite on the map now triggers a categorized event in the `IntelFeed`, complete with specialized satellite icons and purple accenting.
  - **Orbital Feed Filtering:** Users can now toggle orbital-specific intelligence events independently within the stream.

### Changed

- **Signal Source Nomenclature:** Standardized the satellite signal source label to `ORBITAL_Poller` in the detailed sidebar.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Tactical Halo System (Sovereign Glass refinement):**
  - **Locked-to-Icon Highlighting:** Replaced redundant amber icon outlines with a procedural "Tactical Halo" sprite.
  - **Concentric Rendering:** Redesigned as a soft 32px radial glow that perfectly tracks icon billboarding, rotation, and projection in Globe/3D views.
- **Globe View Activation:**
  - **Spherical Projection:** Enabled native globe rendering in `TacticalMap.tsx`, supported by Mapbox v3+ or the newly verified MapLibre v5 upgrade.
  - **Projection Stabilization:** Re-aligned all tactical overlays (trails, footprints, stems) to track accurately on spherical surfaces with zero terrestrial clipping.
- **Unified Tactical UI:**
  - **Map View Control Relocation:** Moved the 2D/3D and Globe View toggles from the global `TopBar.tsx` directly onto the `TacticalMap.tsx` map surface for localized, context-aware interaction.
  - **Topbar Cleanup:** Removed the redundant `Orb_Layer` and map projection buttons from the Topbar to maximize HUD space for mission-critical intelligence.
  - **Layer Filter Header Refinement:** Relocated the expansion chevrons (AIR, SEA, ORBITAL) to the right-side gutter for cleaner visual alignment with toggle switches.
  - **Orbital Header Unification:** Standardized the ORBITAL filter group to match the AIR and SEA tactical styles.

### Changed

- **Tactical Depth Matrix:** Standardized `depthBias` across the entire map stack:
  1. Velocity Vectors (`-220.0`)
  2. Selection Ring (`-215.0`)
  3. Primary Icon (`-210.0`)
  4. Tactical Halo (`-209.0`)
  5. Trails / Footprints (`-101.0`)
  6. Altitude Stems (`-100.0`)
- **Visual Stylization:** Upgraded velocity vectors and ground tracks to `jointRounded` and `capRounded` PathLayers for professional tactical aesthetics.

- **Special Entity Metadata:** Suppressed redundant `GENERAL_AVIATION` tags for specialized assets (Drones, Helicopters) in the HUD.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Orbital Pulse Ingestion (Backend):**
  - **Celestrak Tracking:** New `sovereign-orbital-pulse` Python service continually fetching TLEs for active satellites across five categories (GPS, Weather, Active, Surveillance, Comms).
  - **Live SGP4 Propagation:** In-memory numpy-accelerated 30s micro-batched positional resolution simulating live orbit characteristics.
  - **Kafka Ingestion:** Produces `a-s-K` TAK Protocol messages to a new `orbital_raw` Redpanda topic.
- **Orbital Visualization Layer (Frontend):**
  - **Deck.gl Overlays:** Implemented `OrbitalLayer.tsx` featuring marker rendering, continuous ground-track projection, and orbital footprints.
  - **Satellite Telemetry UI:** Enriched `SidebarRight.tsx` with orbital contact metadata — altitude (km), velocity (km/s), orbital period, NORAD ID, and category.
  - **Layer Filtering:** Robust satellite-category filtering (`GPS`, `Weather`, `Comms`, `Surveillance`) integrated into global layer controls and `TacticalMap.tsx`.
  - **AOR Intel Feeds:** Footprint-overlap detection emits categorized `orbital` INTEL events for satellites passing over the mission AOR.
- **Orbital Layer TopBar Controls:** Added `Orb_Layer` and `Globe_View` toggle buttons to `TopBar.tsx`, state persisted to `localStorage`.
- **Globe View Groundwork:** Full wiring implemented through `App.tsx`, `TopBar.tsx`, and `TacticalMap.tsx`. Dual-path projection logic ready — `map.setProjection()` (Mapbox GL v3+) with style-injection fallback (MapLibre GL). Pending MapLibre GL v5 upgrade to activate.

### Fixed

- **Satellite Category Filtering:** Corrected category extraction path `entity.detail?.category ?? entity.detail?.classification?.category` — sub-filters (GPS/Weather/Comms/Surveillance) were silently passing all satellites through.
- **Satellite Color Synchronization:** `getSatColor()` in `OrbitalLayer.tsx` now exactly matches filter chip colors in `LayerFilters.tsx` (GPS→`sky-400`, Weather→`amber-400`, Comms→`emerald-400`, Surveillance→`rose-400`).
- **Intel Stream Noise:** Suppressed per-frame `onEvent` calls from orbital footprint detections that flooded the intelligence feed.

### Known Issues / Technical Debt

- **Globe View Requires MapLibre GL v5:** `setProjection()` is not present in MapLibre GL JS v3.x. The button UI and code wiring are complete; activation requires upgrading `maplibre-gl` to v5 (see `FEATURE-ROADMAP-PHASE-8.md` for research checklist).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Maritime Ingestion Payload Enhancement:** Extended the AIS poller to ingest `ShipStaticData` and `StandardClassBPositionReport`. Built specific ship cache handling with TTL cleanup for dynamic metadata enrichment.
- **TAK Protocol Evolution:** Upgraded the TAK Protocol (`tak.proto`) to include granular `vesselClassification` attributes (ship category, nav status, flag, dimensions, etc).
- **Expanded Filtering Matrix:** Added detailed sub-class toggles in `IntelFeed` and `TacticalMap` to separate sea traffic into 11 categories (Cargo, Tanker, Fishing, SAR, Military, Tug, etc) plus Drones for the air.
- **Tactical Entity Selection:** Added tactical orange outline and text color highlighting for priority special entities (SAR, Military, Law enforcement vessels, helicopters, drones) across the map and HUD.

### Changed

- **UI Streamlining**: Reduced visual clutter in `LayerFilters.tsx` by eliminating redundant collection headers.
- **Filter Harmonization**: Mapped "unknown" maritime objects intelligently to the `showSpecial` filter across both live intelligence and map replays.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Dead Reckoning Heading Fallback:** Corrected a read-after-write bug where `drStateRef.current.get()` was called after `drStateRef.current.set()` for the same entity. The previous position used for bearing calculation was always identical to the new position (distance = 0), making the kinematic heading fallback dead code. New entities and entities with short trails now compute heading correctly from delta position.
- **Animation Loop Smoothing After Pause:** Capped the lerp `smoothDt` to 33ms independently of the outer `dt` (which is capped at 100ms for physics safety). At `dt=100ms` the old `smoothFactor` reached ~0.73, causing a 73% position jump in one frame when resuming after a GC pause or tab-switch. The new cap keeps blending gradual on resume.
- **Icon Rotation at 0°/360° Boundary:** `blendCourseRad` is now normalized to `[0°, 360°]` before being assigned as the entity `course`. The angle interpolation code uses `[-π, π]` range internally, which could produce negative degree values and incorrect icon rotation direction when crossing north.
- **ADS-B MLAT Duplicate Suppression:** Raised `ARBI_MIN_SPATIAL_M` from 30m to 100m in the backend poller arbitration logic. MLAT multilateration noise across ground station networks is typically 50–150m; the old 30m threshold caused reports from two sources triangulating the same aircraft to both bypass the temporal gate and publish near-simultaneous snapping position updates.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **History Trail Artifacts:**
  - **Zigzag Elimination:** Implemented temporal (3s) and spatial (50m) gating to prevent noisy ADS-B updates from creating sawtooth patterns in history trails.
  - **Detached Head Fix:** Added a dynamic "Gap Bridge" render layer that visually connects the last confirmed history point to the live interpolated entity, ensuring trails look continuous without corruption.
- **Intelligence Stream Performance:**
  - **Memory Cap:** Limited client-side event retention to 500 items to prevent heap bloat.
  - **Render Limit:** Restricted simultaneous DOM nodes in the Intel Feed to the latest 50 events to maintain 60fps UI performance.

### Added

- **Trail Visualization:**
  - **Selected Entity Bridge:** High-priority gap bridging for the currently selected target to ensure immediate visual feedback during tracking.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Advanced Aircraft Classification:** Deep integration of aircraft metadata including Affiliation (Military/Civ), Platform Type, Service Class (Narrowbody/Regional/Cargo), and Squawk descriptions.
- **Granular HUD Filters:** Added specialized toggles for Military, Government, Commercial (including Regional/Cargo sub-types), Private (Business Jets/Light Aircraft), and Helicopter assets.
- **Smooth Kinematic Rendering:**
  - **Rotation Interpolation:** Icons now glide smoothly between headings during turns instead of snapping.
  - **Stable History Trails:** Implemented "Lead-in" visual head logic and 50m noise filtering to ensure trails are smooth and perfectly aligned with aircraft movement.
- **Intelligence Event Management:**
  - **Time-Based Expiration:** Intel feed now uses a 1-hour rolling window with automatic data purging to prevent performance degradation and maintain tactical relevance.
- **Performance Optimizations:**

### Changed

- **Tactical Zoom Defaults:**
  - Search Result Zoom: Adjusted from 14 to **12**.
  - Intel Stream Zoom: Adjusted from 14 to **12**.
- **Entity Selection:** Standardized selection handlers to strictly disable "Follow Mode" effectively when context switching.

### Fixed

- **Follow Mode:**
  - **Soft Lock Fix:** Fixed "soft lock" issues where manual interaction wouldn't reliably break the camera lock.
  - **Easing Conflict:** Restored `isEasing` checks to prevent camera conflicts during fly-to operations.
  - **Grace Period:** Increased grace period to 3s to improve lock-on reliability for distant targets.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Projective Velocity Blending (PVB):**
  - **Rendering Engine Upgrade:** Replaced legacy dead reckoning with a physics-based velocity projection system.
  - **Zero Rubber-Banding:** Algorithms now project _forward_ from the last known visual state, eliminating backward correction jumps.
  - **Smooth Transitions:** 3-step interpolation (Server Projection -> Client Projection -> Blend) ensures fluid motion for high-speed assets.

### Changed

- **Performance Tuning:**
  - **Animation Loop:** Optimized `TacticalMap` render loop to use refs, eliminating ~30Hz cleanup/setup cycles during selection updates.

    - Added 30m spatial bypass to instantly capture fast maneuvers (high-G turns) that would otherwise be rate-limited.

### Fixed

- **Motion Artifacts:**
  - Fixed "backward snapping" when new packets arrived with slightly older timestamps or different latency profiles.
  - Fixed stationary entity drift by implementing strict speed clamping (< 0.5 m/s).

  - **Live Updates:** Real-time property updates for selected entities in the sidebar.
  - **Unified 3D Centering:** Implemented `getCompensatedCenter` to ensure the camera focus remains on the aircraft chevron rather than the ground, accounting for pitch and altitude.
- **Synchronized Telemetry:** Sidebar numbers now update at 30Hz in perfect lockstep with the map's interpolated camera movement.
- **Intelligent Zoom Defaults:** The "Center" action now uses **Zoom 12** as its tactical default and respects manual zoom levels within the 12-18 range.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Hybrid 3D Engine (Mapbox + CARTO):**
  - **Dual-Mode Rendering:** Automatically switches between **Mapbox GL JS** (Photorealistic 3D) and **MapLibre GL** (Lightweight 2D) based on token availability.
  - **CARTO Integration:** Implemented **CARTO Dark Matter** as the default high-performance basemap for disconnected/local-only operations.

    - **Ground Shadows:** Dynamic projected shadows for airborne assets to aid depth perception.
    - **Camera Control:** New Pitch ($0^{\circ}-85^{\circ}$) and Bearing controls for tactical perspective.

### Changed

- **Tactical Display Improvements (CoT Alignment Fix):**
  - **Trail Geometry Alignment:** Icons now align with the _last two points_ of their history trail, ensuring perfect visual correlation with the ground track.
  - **Rhumb Line Math:** Switched bearing calculations to Loxodrome formulas to match the Mercator projection exactly.
